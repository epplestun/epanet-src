epanet base code

__Note:__ This is not the "official" release of EPANET -- for that, please go to [the USEPA website](http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/dw/epanet.html). 

However, if you are interested in extending EPANET for academic, personal, or commercial use, then this is probably a good place to be.

This is a modified version of EPANET to search for feasible solution for a constraint problem. This solution is currently under development.
